# cryptocurrencies
Data Analysis Bootcamp - Week 18

## Overview
The purpose of this repo is to gain comfort with unsupervised machine learning. In the lesson module we learned about k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms, along with dimensionality reduction through PCA. For the challenge we were given a csv full of data about cryptocurrencies and then were asked to run k-means clustering on it and display the results. All that work can be found in [crypto_clustering.ipynb}](crypto_clustering.ipynb)
